# Black Box System combined with CPTED(Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design)

## 1. Project Overview
- Selected as one of 300 participating teams nationwide for a 6-month professional development project for Black Box System combined with CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) in tech based on Embedded System, Cloud Server, and Mobile Application
- This project is based on the concept combining 'Social Science' and 'Electrical Engineering' with the goal of decreasing crime rates by establishing a monitoring system with car black box, recognizing the possibility for the crime to occur in advance, and alerting police officers to the occurrence of the crime. The ultimate goal of this project is to foster the social atmosphere thwarting a lot of culprits in committing the crime. To handle with private issue, the technology of public key in asymmetric cryptosystem would be used.
